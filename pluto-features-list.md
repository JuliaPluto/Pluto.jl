## 1. Reactivity & Execution Model

- **Reactive notebook execution** — Cells automatically re-run when their dependencies change, like a spreadsheet. (#20, #37)
- **Distributed execution** — Each notebook runs in its own Julia process using Malt.jl (formerly Distributed.jl). (#66, #2240, #2767)
- **Cell dependency graph** — Pluto builds a full dependency graph between cells and only re-runs affected cells. (#37)
- **Topological ordering** — Cells are executed in dependency order, not top-to-bottom. (#37)
- **Function-based cell wrapping** — Cell code is wrapped in functions so Julia can compile and cache it for speed. (#720)
- **Reactive `using` / `import`** — Adding or removing `using` or `import` statements reactively updates the notebook. (#1541)
- **Reactive method definitions** — Defining or redefining methods in other cells triggers reactive updates. (#1554)
- **Cyclic dependency detection** — Pluto detects and reports cyclic cell dependencies. (#37)
